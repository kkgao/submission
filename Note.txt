build a palm and take forward ??
he is pretty high integrity
I do not want to boil the ocean (long time)
The contribution I made on the daily base can move the needle, and increase the value of Marvell.
I censiouly believe ....??
create prosperity for people
Marvell had a good equity program. But for me, it is not at my level of satisfaction.
35'




To do list:
1. Review specification documents for 56G and 12G (low priority).
2. Review c codes for 56G
3. Plan and organize the SVN and contents of document for each SerDes project
4.

нн1. Difference bet. data sampler and slicer sampler? Total number 12, half and half for even and odd path
2. edge sampler : Total number 2
3. MSB threshold ->0
4. LSB threshold Vref: shared for data and slicer sampler; separate bet. even and odd path
5. Partial DFE feedback in CTLE, F3 to F15 and FF1 to FF6 are shared for all samplers in even (odd) path.
6. question:PAM4 decoder logic
MSB = MSB sampler output
LSB = (MSB? LSBP sampler output: LSBN sampler output).
7. Adaptation for Even and odd paths are independent and at the different time.
8. Functionality of 2 to 2 MUX
9. Definition of RX_DFE/EOM
10.  Question: ??EVEN DATA samplers output are forced to be F1 polarity for ODD DATA sampler adaptation. Therefore, EVEN DATA samplers cannot adapt. 
11.  EVEN path and ODD path cannot be adapted simultaneously.
12. DATA and SLICER samplers cannot be adapted simultaneously.
13. The measured peak amplitude is after ALL DFE cancellation. The meaningful peak amplitude is after partial DFE feedback (F3 and later).
14. pWhat is F0D_FB_mode
15. what is F0A,F0B,F0D, Dn1
Dn1 -> D-1, future data
16. What are PU_DFE, PU_OS,PU_VCM
